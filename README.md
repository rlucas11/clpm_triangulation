# clpm_triangulation

This code simulates data that could be analyzed with the cross-lagged panel model. Specifically, it addresses predictions raised in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ztwy6](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ztwy6). The authors make predictions about what true versus spurious lagged effects look like. However, they only examine a very limited scenario. The simulation tests when the predictions do and do not hold.
